# Install on Windows
Use the Powershell installer, and it must be ran as administrator or it will fail. It will wait for you to copy the local splunk admin password. Keep this in a safe place, it may be needed in the future. You'll also need to replace <your_deployment_server> with the URL of your deployment server on line 19. I'll try to keep this updated with the latest version of the forwarder as they come out.
